### Explanation:

## We define a function two_sum that takes an array nums and a target integer target

## We initialize an empty dictionary called complement_dict. This dictionary will store the complement of each number encountered so far, along with its index in the array

## We iterate through the array nums using enumerate() to simultaneously get the index i and the value num

## For each number num, we calculate the complement needed to achieve the target sum (complement = target - num)

## We check if this complement exists in the complement_dict. If it does, it means we have found the pair that adds up to the target sum, so we return the indices of the current number i and the index of its complement stored in complement_dict[complement]

## If the complement does not exist in the dictionary, we add the current number and its index to the dictionary

## If no such pair is found after iterating through the entire array, we return an empty list
