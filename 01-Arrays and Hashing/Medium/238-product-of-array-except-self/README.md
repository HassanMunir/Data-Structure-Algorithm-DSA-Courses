## Explanation

### class Solution:: This defines a class named Solution. In Python, classes are used to bundle data and functionality together. It appears that this class is intended to contain a solution to some problem

### def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]: This defines a method named productExceptSelf within the Solution class. This method takes a list of integers (nums) as input and returns a list of integers as output. The method will calculate the product of all elements in nums except for the current element at each index

### res = [1] \* (len(nums)): This initializes a list named res with all elements set to 1. The length of this list is the same as the input list nums. This list will ultimately store the result

### prefix = 1: This initializes a variable prefix with a value of 1. This variable is used to keep track of the product of all elements to the left of the current element

### for i in range(len(nums)): This loop iterates over each index in the input list nums

### res[i] = prefix: For each index i, it sets the value at index i in the res list to the current value of prefix. This effectively stores the product of all elements to the left of the current element at index i in the res list

### prefix \*= nums[i]: After updating res[i], it multiplies prefix by the current element at index i. This prepares prefix for the next iteration

### After the first loop, prefix contains the product of all elements to the left of each element in the input list

### postfix = 1: This initializes a variable postfix with a value of 1. This variable is used to keep track of the product of all elements to the right of the current element

### for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):: This loop iterates over each index in the input list nums, starting from the last index and moving backwards

### res[i] \*= postfix: For each index i, it multiplies the value at index i in the res list by the current value of postfix. This effectively updates the value in res to the product of all elements to the left and right of the current element at index i

### postfix \*= nums[i]: After updating res[i], it multiplies postfix by the current element at index i. This prepares postfix for the next iteration

### After the second loop, each element in the res list contains the product of all elements except the element at the corresponding index in the input list nums

### Finally, the method returns the res list, which contains the desired result
