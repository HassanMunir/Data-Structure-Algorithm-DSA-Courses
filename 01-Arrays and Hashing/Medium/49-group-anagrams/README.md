## Explanation

### res = defaultdict(list): This line initializes a defaultdict named res. A defaultdict is a subclass of the built-in dict class, which returns a default value when a key is not found. In this case, it's initialized with an empty list. This dictionary will be used to store groups of anagrams

### for s in strs:: This starts a loop iterating over each string s in the input list strs

### count = [0] \* 26: This line initializes a list named count with 26 elements, each initialized to 0. This list will be used to count the occurrences of each character in the current string s

### for c in s:: This starts a loop iterating over each character c in the current string s

### count[ord(c) - ord("a")] += 1: This line increments the count of the character c in the count list. It does this by converting the character c to its ASCII value using the ord() function, then subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' to get a zero-based index corresponding to the character's position in the alphabet. This count helps identify the unique "signature" of each anagram group

### res[tuple(count)].append(s): This line appends the current string s to the list stored in the res dictionary at the key corresponding to the tuple representation of the count list. Since lists are not hashable and cannot be used as dictionary keys, the count list is converted to a tuple to make it hashable

### return res.values(): Finally, the method returns a list of all values stored in the res dictionary. Each value is a list containing strings that are anagrams of each other
