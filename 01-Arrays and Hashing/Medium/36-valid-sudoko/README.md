## Explanation

### cols, rows, and squares are initialized as defaultdicts of sets. These will be used to keep track of the numbers already seen in each column, row, and 3x3 subgrid (square) respectively

### Nested loops iterate over each cell of the Sudoku board using indices r and c to represent row and column indices respectively

### Inside the loop:

#### If the current cell contains a ".", indicating an empty cell, the loop continues to the next iteration

#### Otherwise, if the current cell contains a digit (from '1' to '9'):

##### It checks whether the digit is already present in the current row (rows[r]), current column (cols[c]), or the square it belongs to (squares[(r // 3, c // 3)])

##### If the digit is found in any of these sets, it means there's a violation of Sudoku rules, and the function returns False, indicating the board is not valid

##### Otherwise, the digit is added to the respective sets for the current row, column, and square

### If the loop completes without finding any violations (i.e., all cells are checked and no duplicate digits are found in any row, column, or square), the function returns True, indicating that the Sudoku board is valid
