## Explanation

### Class Definition: The code starts by defining a class named Solution

### Method Definition: Within the class, there is a method named longestConsecutive. This method takes a list of integers (nums) as input and returns an integer (the length of the longest consecutive sequence)

### Set Initialization: It creates a set called numSet from the input list nums. Using a set here helps in efficient lookup operations

### Variable Initialization: longest variable is initialized to 0. This variable will store the length of the longest consecutive sequence found

### Loop through Numbers: It iterates through each number (n) in the input list nums

### Check Start of Sequence: For each number, it checks if n-1 is not in numSet. If n-1 is not in numSet, it means n could be the start of a consecutive sequence

### Find Length of Consecutive Sequence: If n is the start of a sequence, it enters a while loop to find the length of the consecutive sequence starting from n. It increments the length variable until n + length is not in numSet

### Update Longest: After exiting the while loop, it compares the length of the current sequence with the longest variable and updates longest if the current sequence is longer

### Return Longest: Finally, it returns the longest variable, which holds the length of the longest consecutive sequence found
