## Explanation

### This code defines a class named Solution. It appears to be a solution to a problem or a function that performs a specific task

### Inside the Solution class, there's a method named topKFrequent. This method takes three parameters:

#### self: This parameter refers to the instance of the class itself

#### nums: It's a list of integers. Presumably, this list contains numbers for which we want to find the top k frequent elements

#### k: It's an integer indicating the number of top frequent elements we want to find

### Two dictionaries are initialized:

#### count: This dictionary will store the count of occurrences of each number in the input list nums

#### freq: This is a list of lists where each inner list represents a frequency bucket. The length of this list is len(nums) + 1. Each bucket will contain elements having the same frequency

### This loop iterates through each number in the input list nums and counts the occurrences of each number using the count dictionary

### After counting the occurrences, this loop iterates through the items in the count dictionary. It assigns each number to its corresponding frequency bucket in the freq list

### This part of the code constructs the result list res by iterating through the frequency buckets in reverse order (starting from the highest frequency). It appends the elements from each bucket to res until res contains k elements. Then it returns res
