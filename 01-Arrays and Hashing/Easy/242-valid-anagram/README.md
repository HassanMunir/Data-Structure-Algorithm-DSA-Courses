## Explanation

### The function 'isAnagram' takes two strings 's' and 't' as input and returns 'True' if 's' and 't' are anagrams, otherwise False

### The first check compares the lengths of the strings. If they are not equal, they cannot be anagrams, so the function returns False

### Hashmaps 'countS' and 'countT' are created to count the occurrences of characters in strings 's' and 't' respectively

### The first loop iterates through each character in string s, updating the count of each character in the countS hashmap

### Similarly, the second loop iterates through each character in string t, updating the count of each character in the countT hashmap

### After counting occurrences of characters in both strings, the function compares the counts of characters in both hashmaps. If any character count in s doesn't match its count in t, they are not anagrams, and the function returns False

### If all characters have matching counts, the function returns True, indicating that the strings are anagrams
