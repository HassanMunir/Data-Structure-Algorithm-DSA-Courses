## Explanation

### The code begins with defining a class named Solution. This class seems to be intended for solving a specific problem, although the context isn't fully provided here

### Inside the class Solution, there is a method isAnagram defined. This method takes in three parameters: self, s, and t

#### self: This parameter refers to the instance of the class. It's a standard practice in Python to include self as the first parameter in instance methods

#### s: This parameter is expected to be a string

#### t: This parameter is also expected to be a string

### The return type annotation -> bool indicates that this method is expected to return a boolean value (True or False)

### The first if condition checks whether the lengths of strings s and t are equal. If they are not, it immediately returns False, indicating that the strings cannot be anagrams if they have different lengths

### Two dictionaries countS and countT are initialized. These dictionaries will be used to count occurrences of characters in strings s and t, respectively

### The code iterates through the indices of the strings (assuming both strings are of the same length, as ensured by the length check)

### For each character at index i in string s, it increments the count of that character in the countS dictionary

### Similarly, for each character at index i in string t, it increments the count of that character in the countT dictionary

### After counting occurrences of characters in both strings, the code iterates through the keys of countS

### For each character c in countS, it checks whether the count of c in countS is equal to the count of c in countT. If not, it means the characters are not present in equal frequencies in both strings, so it returns False

### If the code successfully passes through all characters and their counts are equal, it returns True, indicating that the strings are anagrams of each other
