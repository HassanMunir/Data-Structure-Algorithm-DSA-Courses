## Explanation

### class Solution: This defines a class named Solution. This is a common convention when solving problems in platforms like LeetCode, where the solution to a problem is expected to be written as a method within a class.

### def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:: This defines a method twoSum within the Solution class. It takes in three parameters:

#### self: This is a reference to the current instance of the class

#### nums: This is a list of integers, representing the input array

#### target: This is an integer, representing the target sum

### prevMap = {}: This initializes an empty dictionary named prevMap. This dictionary will be used to store previously encountered numbers along with their indices

### for i, n in enumerate(nums):: This iterates through the elements of the nums list along with their corresponding indices. enumerate() is a built-in Python function that returns both the index and value of each item in a list

### diff = target - n: For each number n in the nums list, it calculates the difference between the target and n. This difference represents the number that, when added to n, gives the target sum

### if diff in prevMap:: This checks if the calculated difference diff is already present in the prevMap dictionary. If it is, it means that diff has been encountered before, and adding it to the current number n will result in the target sum

### return [prevMap[diff], i]: If the difference diff is found in the prevMap, it returns a list containing the indices of the previously encountered number (diff) and the current number n. These indices represent the indices of the two numbers that sum up to the target

### prevMap[n] = i: If the difference diff is not found in the prevMap, it adds the current number n to the prevMap dictionary with its index i. This allows future iterations to look up whether the current number's complement has been seen before

### return: If no solution is found after iterating through all elements of the nums list, it returns None. This indicates that there is no valid solution to the problem within the given input array
